## Review

Way to go! Here are some of the major concepts for conditionals:

- An `if` statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to `true`.

- `if...else` statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.

- We can add more conditions using `else if` statements.

- Comparison operators, including `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `===`, and `!==` can compare two values.

- The logical and operator, `&&`, or "and", checks if both provided expressions are truthy.

- The logical operator `||`, or "or", checks if either provided expression is truthy.

- The bang operator, `!`, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.

- The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise `if...else` statements.

- A `switch` statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple `else if` statements. The `break` keyword stops the remaining `cases` from being checked and executed in a `switch` statement.
